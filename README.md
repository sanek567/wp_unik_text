== Description ==
Wp Unik Text is a plugin for Wordpress that allows you to synonymize text both automatically (suitable for parsing) and manually.
When synonymizing, a database of user synonyms is used, which can be added through the plugin settings interface.
For Russian-language texts, additional synonymizing services are integrated into the plugin: unik-text.ru and textorobot.ru.
